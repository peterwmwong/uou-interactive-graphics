# metal-shader-app

- Consider creating a ShaderToy-esque crate that allows you to quickly create a metal-app with just
  a **Fragment** Shader
- As such, assumes the following configuration...
    - Application/Window setup
    - Window Resize maintenance
        - Resize depth attachment texture
    - Single Render Pipeline
        - Color Attachment
        - Depth Attachment
        - Fragment shader
            - Function name of `main()`
            - Bound buffers
                - Mouse
                    - Coordinate
                    - Button states
                - Time
                - Viewport/Screen Size (pixels)
    - Render
        - One draw call (triangle strip that's a quad fits the screen exactly)
- Question: Would it be better to allow specifying more than just a Fragment shader?
    - Geometry (vertices)
    - Vertex shader
        - This should simplify...
            - Applying Perspective Projection
            - Remove the need to Ray Marching
                - Which one is worse/harder?
                    - Ray Marching and SDF
                    - Vertices, Vertex Shader, Draw call
                        - Maybe there's a Vertices/Draw call simplification? Just provide vertices and assume a draw call with triangle primitive and vertex count.

# metal-app

# metal-build

- Switching between release/dev build doesn't seem to rebuild shader_bindings.
    - Wish we could add `#[cfg_attr(debug_assertions), derive(Debug)]` to bindgen
- Can bindgen replace vector types (ex. float2) with SIMD<?,?> equivalents?
    - This should remove/reduce the need for vector_type_helpers

# xcode-project

- Look at Apple Developer Sample Code projects on how a scheme's executable is referenced in a non-absolute path way
    - Currently `/Users/pwong` shows for Run and Profile schemes.

# tasks.json

- Could saving a metal file, auto restart a running application (based on the crate directory)?
    - Would make fiddling shaders alot faster, but maybe it's not any faster than doing it in xcode shader debugger?
